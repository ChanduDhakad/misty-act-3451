            <h1>Body Surface Area BSA Calculator For Medicinal Purposes</h1>
            <p>This calculator measures the total surface area of the body to determine the dosage of drugs or the
                amount of fluids. This measurement is used for medicinal purposes only.</p>

        <h1 class="head">What Is Body Surface Area?</h1>
        <p class="Answer">It is the calculated surface area of the body. It is often clinically determined to measure
            the metabolic mass of the body and is less likely to be affected by fat mass. BSA measurement is important
            to measure cardiac index (relates heart performance to body size of the individual).</p>
        <h1 class="head">How To Calculate Body Surface Area?</h1>
        <p class="Answer">BSA depends on the height and weight of an individual.</p>
        <h1 class="head">Mosteller Formula</h1>
        <p class="Answer">BSA = 0.016667 × W0.5 × H0.5</p>
        <p class="Answer">Where W is the weight of a person in kg/lbs, and H is the height of a person in cm/inch.</p>

        <h1 class="head">BSA is calculated for clinical purposes to determine the following:</h1>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li class="Answer">Cardiac Index: BSA determines the functioning of the heart based on body size.</li>
            <li class="Answer">Renal Clearance Rate : BSA is required to determine glomerular filtration rate.</li>
            <li class="Answer">The dose of chemotherapy is often determined by BSA value</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="bk">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p class="answer"><span class="A">A</span>The normal BSA is generally taken to be 1.7 m².</p>
        <p class="ques"><span class="Q">Q</span>What BSA is obese?</p>
        <p class="answer"><span class="A">A</span>The BSA in obese people is 2.21 +/- 0.22 m².</p>
        <p class="ques"><span class="Q">Q</span>What is the difference between BSA and BMI?</p>
        <p class="answer"><span class="A">A</span>BMI is the measure of a person’s body fat mass, while BSA is the total
            surface area of a person’s body.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="answer"><span class="A">A</span>According to Dubois, BSA = (Weight [kg] 0.425 × height [cm] 0.725) ×
            0.007184.</p>
